# chatdolphin-webui
My attempt at improving [NLP Cloud's ChatDolphin web UI](https://chat.nlpcloud.com/)

## Features
### Improved UI
UI is improved.

### Saving/Loading
Conversations can be saved and loaded as JSON files.

### Data persistence
Conversations will not be erased when the page is refreshed or closed.

### Context input
The context parameter can be utilized which gives additional details like the mood of the characters, facts about the persons involved, historical details, etc. and aids the AI on how they should respond.

### Custom messages
Conversations can be manually added which allows for few-shot learning and aids the AI on how they should respond.
