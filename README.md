# chatdolphin-webui

My attempt at making an enhanced version of [NLP Cloud's ChatDolphin web UI](https://chat.nlpcloud.com/)

## Key Features

- **Improved UI:** Redesigned and optimized for better usability and visual appeal.
  
- **Context Input:** Users can provide additional details such as mood, historical context, etc., enhancing AI understanding for more relevant responses.
  
- **Custom Dialogue:** Users can manually add conversations which allows for few-shot learning, guiding the AI for tailored interactions.
  
- **Message Editing:** Users can edit messages to steer conversations as desired.
  
- **Message Deletion:** Allows users to backtrack and refine dialogue points as needed.
  
- **Message Reloading:** Users can prompt alternative AI responses by reloading messages.
  
- **Saving/Loading Conversations:** Enables users to save and load conversations as JSON files for future visit.
  
- **Data Persistence:** Conversations are persistently stored for seamless continuity across sessions.

## Usage

To start chatting with the ChatDolphin Web UI, you will need an NLP Cloud API Token.
